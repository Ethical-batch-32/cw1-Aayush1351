## Little description about the website

This is a fully responsive Recipe sharing website, where a user can create a recipe and share with all of the users using this site globally. The user can add the Recipe preparation time and cooking time as well as how many person it can be served for. Users can view the full details of the recipe by clicking on the "Read more" button but they won't be able to interfere with their data such as deleting or changing them. Last but not the least, they can add their profile picture on the site and their name will be shown on the recipe which they have created globally.
